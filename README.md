# Description
This is a simple solver for the classic puzzle game Hashi (sometimes called just
bridges). The player is presented with a number of nodes lying on a grid, each
with a number. The goal is to connect bridges between the nodes such that each
node has the number of bridges specified by its number. The rules are as 
follows:
- Bridges can be connected between nodes that lie on the same row or column,
  provided that they are not obstructed by another node or bridge
- Up to two bridges can be placed between two nodes
